# CweepahCraft-Backup
Backs up a Minecraft world to a remote server via SSH.

Only works on a Linux-based OS with rsync and ssh installed. The local machine needs to be configured to connect to the remote server through SSH using a keypair. The remote server must have rsync, df, and of course an SSH server installed.
